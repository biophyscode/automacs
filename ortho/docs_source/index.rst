:mod:`ortho` [orthogonal tools]
===============================

The ``ortho`` package supplies a number of useful tools for standardizing complicated Python codes with a consistent user interface via ``make``, a configuration file called ``config.json`` and various extra√±a that allow developers to focus on writing novel code. There is no particular ansatz to ``ortho``. It serves only as a collection of useful, general-purpose tools which are not available in the standard libraries.
