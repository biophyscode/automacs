**"Automatic GROMACS"** (a.k.a. AUTOMACS or just **amx** for short) is a biophysics simulation pipeline designed to help you run scalable, reproducible, and extensible simulations using the popular `GROMACS <www.gromacs.org>`_ integrator. The documentation :ref:`walkthrough <contents>` below describes how the codes work (and how you should use them). The :ref:`components <components>` section describes the codes available in **this particular** copy of automacs, including any extensions you may have downloaded.

Everything but the kitchen sink can be found by :ref:`searching <search>` the :ref:`index <genindex>`. Before starting the walkthrough, you must collect additional automacs modules by running the following :any:`setup <cli.setup>` command with the ``all`` recipe. If this is your first time running automacs on a particular computer, you should also :ref:`configure the gromacs paths <gmx_config>` by running :any:`make gromacs_config <cli.gromacs_config>`.

.. code-block :: bash
  
  make gromacs_config local
  make setup all

.. _contents:

The following sections explain how you can interact with the codes and outline the relatively minimal set of design constraints required for extending the codes to new use cases. The :ref:`components <components>` section at the end includes the "live" documentation for your extension modules.

.. include:: concept.rst
.. include:: configuration.rst
.. include:: interface.rst
.. include:: framework.rst
